# Real-Life-Bank
An application that started as a simple banking management system but turned into a lot more.
It now features a small store where you can buy items, soon also sell, with either of the two different payment methods and the items you buy are stored in your inventory.
There is also a feature where you can gamble the money in your "wallet" by shooting dice.
The amount you win is double the amount you bet.
I will be adding blackjack as another game to gamble on soon.
I will also be adding ways to work for your money and also risk it by doing robberies.
